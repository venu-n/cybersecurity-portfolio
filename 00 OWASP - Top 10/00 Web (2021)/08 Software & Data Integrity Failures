## 8. Software & Data Integrity Failures
   Overview: Weaknesses in code or infrastructure that allow unauthorised modification of software, data or update processes
   Impact:
     Attackers can insert malicious code, backdoors or modify data integrity
     Leads to supplychain attacks and loss of system trust
     Compromises both end users and internal infrastructure

   Attack Vectors & Remediation
     a. Untrusted Software Updates
          Vector: Updating apps from unauthenticated or insecure sources
          Remediation: Sign all updates digitally; verify signatures before applying

     b. Insecure Deserialisation
          Vector: Modifying serialised objects to execute arbitrary code
          Remediation: Avoid native deserialisation of untrusted input; use safe formats (JSON) and validate schema

     c. Malicious CI/CD Pipeline Manipulation
          Vector: Attacker modifies build scripts or injects malicious dependencies
          Remediation: Use least privilege in pipelines, integrity checks and separate build/test environments

     d. Unverified Dependencies
          Vector: Importing tampered third-party packages from public repositories
          Remediation: Use package integrity verification (checksums, signed manifests)

     e. Unsigned or Tampered Data Files
          Vector: Altered configuration or firmware files loaded without checks
          Remediation: Use cryptographic integrity checks (HMAC, SHA-256)
