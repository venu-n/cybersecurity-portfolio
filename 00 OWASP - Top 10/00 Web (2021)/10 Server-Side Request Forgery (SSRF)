## 10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
   Overview: When a web app fetches a remote resource based on unvalidated user input, allowing attackers to make server-side requests
   Impact:
     Access to internal networks, metadata APIs, or sensitive files
     Can lead to RCE or data exfiltration

   Attack Vectors & Remediation
     a. Unvalidated URL Fetch
          Vector: User-supplied URL in file fetchers, PDF generators, webhooks
          Remediation: Whitelist safe domains only; block private IP ranges

     b. Open Redirect to SSRF
          Vector: Redirect parameter abused to pivot internal requests
          Remediation: Validate redirect targets strictly (absolute URLs only)

     c. Cloud Metadata Access
          Vector: Access to AWS IMDS (http://169.254.169.254/) for credentials
          Remediation: Block metadata endpoints via firewall; use IMDSv2 (AWS)

     d. Blind SSRF via DNS
          Vector: Triggering server-side DNS lookup for exfiltration
          Remediation: Validate input scheme/host and monitor DNS traffic

Tools / Testing Techniques
  Burp Collaborator / Interactsh -> detect blind SSRF
  ffuf / wfuzz -> discover vulnerable parameters
  curl / requests -> manual SSRF testing
