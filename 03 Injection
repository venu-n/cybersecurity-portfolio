3. Injection

Overview: occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, allowing attackers to execute unintended commands or access data.

Impact:
Data theft, corruption, or deletion.
Remote code execution (RCE).
Full compromise of application and database.

Attack Vectors & Remediation
   a. SQL Injection (SQLi)
        Vector: Manipulating SQL queries via input fields (' 
        OR 1=1--).
        Remediation: Use parameterized queries (prepared 
        statements), ORM frameworks, least DB privileges.

   b. Command Injection
        Vector: Injecting OS commands (; rm -rf /).
        Remediation: Avoid shell calls; use safe APIs; 
        validate input with allowlists.

   c. LDAP Injection
        Vector: Tampering with LDAP queries (*)(|(uid=*))).
        Remediation: Use parameterized LDAP queries; input 
        validation.

   d. NoSQL Injection
        Vector: Modifying NoSQL queries ({"$ne": null}).
        Remediation: Use safe query building methods, 
        sanitize inputs.

   e. XPATH / XML Injection
        Vector: Altering XML/XPath queries (' or '1'='1).
        Remediation: Use parameterized XPath, sanitize XML 
        inputs.

    Burp Suite → Manual payload testing.
    NoSQLMap → NoSQL injection.
    WFuzz / Intruder → Payload fuzzing.
