### 3. Injection
         Overview: Occurs when untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query, allowing attackers to execute unintended commands or access data
         Impact:
           Data theft, corruption, or deletion
           Remote code execution (RCE)
           Full compromise of application and database

         Attack Vectors & Remediation
            a. SQL Injection (SQLi)
                 Vector: Manipulating SQL queries via input fields (' OR 1=1--)
                 Remediation: Use parameterized queries (prepared statements), ORM frameworks, least DB privileges
            b. Command Injection
                 Vector: Injecting OS commands (; rm -rf /)
                 Remediation: Avoid shell calls; use safe APIs; validate input with allowlists
            c. LDAP Injection
                 Vector: Tampering with LDAP queries (*)(|(uid=*)))
                 Remediation: Use parameterised LDAP queries; input validation
            d. NoSQL Injection
                 Vector: Modifying NoSQL queries ({"$ne": null})
                 Remediation: Use safe query building methods, sanitise inputs
            e. XPATH / XML Injection
                 Vector: Altering XML/XPath queries (' or '1'='1)
                 Remediation: Use parameterised XPath, sanitise XML inputs

Tools / Testing Techniques:
    SQLMap -> Automated SQLi detection & exploitation
    Burp Suite -> Manual payload testing
    NoSQLMap -> NoSQL injection
    WFuzz / Intruder -> Payload fuzzing
