## 9. Security Logging & Monitoring Failures
   Overview: Failure to detect, log or alert on security events thus leaving attacks unnoticed
   Impact:
     Attacks go undetected, leading to prolonged breaches
     Incident response becomes slow or impossible
     Legal and compliance violations (e.g., PCI-DSS, ISO 27001)

   Attack Vectors & Remediation
     a. No or Minimal Logging
          Vector: Missing logs for auth or error events
          Remediation: Log key security events: logins, access denials, privilege change

     b. Unprotected Logs
          Vector: Logs exposed to users or writable by attackers
          Remediation: Restrict permissions, encrypt sensitive logs

     c. No Alerting Mechanism
          Vector: SIEM not configured lead to breaches unnoticed
          Remediation: Use SIEM/SOC alerts (Splunk, ELK, Wazuh)

     d. Log Tampering / Deletion
          Vector: Attackers erase evidence
          Remediation: Send logs to remote/immutable storage (e.g. CloudWatch, SIEM)

     e. Sensitive Data in Logs
          Vector: Storing passwords, tokens, PII in logs
          Remediation: Mask or redact sensitive fields before writing logs

Tools / Testing Techniques
  Graylog, ELK, Splunk, Wazuh -> log correlation & alerting
  Sysmon / OSQuery -> host activity tracking
