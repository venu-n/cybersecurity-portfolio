## 7. Identification & Authentication Failures
   Overview: Flaws in authentication or session management allow attackers to assume other users identities
   Impact:
     Account takeover, privilege escalation, identity theft
     Loss of confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data
     High business impact (fraud, reputation loss)

   Attack Vectors & Remediation
     a. Weak or No Password Policy
          Vector: Short/easy-to-guess passwords
          Remediation: Enforce strong password policies (min length, complexity, blacklist common passwords)

     b. Default or Hardcoded Credentials
          Vector: Using vendor defaults or hardcoded creds in code
          Remediation: Remove defaults, rotate secrets, use secret managers

     c. Credential Stuffing / Brute Force
          Vector: Using leaked credentials or automation tools to guess passwords
          Remediation: Implement MFA, rate limiting, account lockout, bot detection

     d. Poor MFA / 2FA Implementation
          Vector: Weak SMS OTP, bypassable MFA logic
          Remediation: Use strong factors (TOTP, push notifications, FIDO2), enforce MFA correctly at all critical flows

     e. Improper Logout / Session Expiry
          Vector: Sessions remain active indefinitely
          Remediation: Implement idle timeout, force re-authentication for sensitive actions

     f. Session Hijacking / Fixation
          Vector: Stealing session cookies via XSS, sniffing, or reusing fixed IDs
          Remediation: Use secure cookie flags (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), regenerate session IDs post-login, use short-lived tokens

Tools / Testing Techniques
  Burp Suite Intruder → Brute-force login forms
  OWASP ZAP → Detect cookie flags
  Session Cookie Tampering → Replay stolen tokens
